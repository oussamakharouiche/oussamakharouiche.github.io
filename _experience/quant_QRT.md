During my research internship at LIX within the DaSciM team, I'm developing **Cell2Text**, a cutting-edge **foundation model** designed to generate automated descriptions of single cells. This project bridges the gap between complex biological data and natural language, aiming to revolutionize how we understand and interact with single-cell information.

My responsibilities include:
* **Biological Data Preprocessing**: Handling and preparing diverse biological datasets, including single-cell RNA sequencing and gene expression data, for model training.
* **Multimodal LLM Development**: Architecting and developing Cell2Text, a **multimodal large language model** that integrates single-cell data with natural language processing techniques. This model will enable automated cell description generation and facilitate answering complex biological questions.
* **Multimodal Fusion Engineering**: Exploring and implementing innovative **multimodal fusion techniques** to extend the Cell2Text framework beyond single-cell analysis to broader biological domains.

Skills:
* **Python**: scikit-learn, PyTorch
* **Fine Tuning**: LoRA
* **Single-cell RNA Sequencing Analysis**
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
* **Machine Learning**
