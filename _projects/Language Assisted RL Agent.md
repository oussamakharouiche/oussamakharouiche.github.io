title: "Language Assisted RL Agent"
---

## Problem Addressed  
Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents excel at optimizing reward signals but lack the ability to interpret and act on high-level **natural language instructions**. This limits their adaptability in real-world scenarios where tasks are often defined through human commands. Our project bridges this gap by integrating **natural language understanding (NLU)** with RL, enabling agents to execute complex textual directives in structured environments.  

## Technologies Used 
* **Python**: Gymnasium, PyGame, PyTorch
* **Git**
